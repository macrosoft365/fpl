Hi! This is the README for this discord bot that I am working on.

I need to figure this out in a few different parts.

The first is that I want to get a simple discord bot up and running.

Once I have that working as expected, I will work on connecting to the FPL API so that we can start to integrate functionality into the bot

Ideally, I'd like for you to be able to put in your league id and have the bot go and grab the most updated standings

I want these standins to have names, team names, current week points, overall points, and players left, and in play.
basically anything that shows on the FLP Gameweek page

We'll start there and see about expanding to anything else wrt functionality

1 - Discord bot

I have to remember to remove the api files from github at some point

Discord bot is working

2 - Now I want to look at the messages.
    if message is digit, take that integer and ping the api
    return the json, turn into dict, print dict?

    else, return



I want to receicve the JSON file, take the data from it that I want/need, then make an ASCII table with it

first I need to know what form the ascii input needs to be 
    maybe this is 2D Python lists??? so then need to figure out how to get json to python lists
then I wanna know how I can get json into that form
